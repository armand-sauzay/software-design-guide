### OOP Code principles

- __Combine OOP and functional programming__    
    - Both approaches have pros and cons and you should know when to use one or the other.
- __Keep your code cohesive__
    - Classes and methods should be small and focused
    - Avoid creating large, complex classes that are difficult to understand and maintain.
- __Name your objects right__
    - Use descriptive and meaningful names
    - Avoid short names like `i`, `p` etc
- __Try to distinguish between data classes and behavioral classes__ 
    - Encapsulate your data and provide accessor and mutator methods for it.
    - Use Behavior classes for "verb-like" actions
- __Use composition over inheritance.__
- __Avoid tight coupling between your classes.__
